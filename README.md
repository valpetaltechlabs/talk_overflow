# Talk::Overflow

🎙️ **Talk::Overflow** — A weekly curation of standout developer talks from the best tech conferences around the world.

## About

A few months ago, I found myself hopping between **five different sites** just to track down a single conference talk I loved — that frustration became my light‑bulb moment.

Talk::Overflow started as a side project to collect and surface the best dev talks — and now it’s a growing hub for people who love tech, ideas, and real conversations.

It’s about spotlighting the talks that move the developer world forward.

## What to Expect

Weekly drops of carefully curated talks and must‑see past talks.

## Thanks

Thanks for being early. You’re part of the story now.

## Substack Integration

Talk::Overflow content is automatically synced from our Substack newsletter. New posts are converted to Markdown and stored in the `/posts` directory on a daily basis using GitHub Actions.

If you want to manually trigger a sync, you can do so by running the "Sync Substack → Markdown" workflow from the Actions tab.
