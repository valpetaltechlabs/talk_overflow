# Talk::Overflow

üéôÔ∏è **Talk::Overflow** ‚Äî A weekly curation of standout developer talks from the best tech conferences around the world.

## About

A few months ago, I found myself hopping between **five different sites** just to track down a single conference talk I loved ‚Äî that frustration became my light‚Äëbulb moment.

Talk::Overflow started as a side project to collect and surface the best dev talks ‚Äî and now it's a growing hub for people who love tech, ideas, and real conversations.

It's about spotlighting the talks that move the developer world forward.

## What to Expect

Weekly drops of carefully curated talks and must‚Äësee past talks.
